      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Shenna Ariola Salcedo, a 20 year old beautiful girl living in her own fantasy world.
      </p>
      <p>
         This Website I created is primarily dedicated for myself. Here you can learn more things about me.
      </p>
      <h2>My Current Goal</h2>
      <p>
        I've just realized that I'm gradually losing interest in the course I took, therefore my current focus is on igniting my enthusiasm for coding even more. 
        I believe I chose the incorrect path because of this, and I feel left behind. However, as I also don't want to squander my two years in this school, I'll make an effort to motivate myself to rediscover the joy and color of programming.
      </p>
